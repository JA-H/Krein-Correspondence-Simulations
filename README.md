# Krein Correspondence Simulations
One of the key results that is used in the author's PhD thesis is the Krein correspondence which provides a one-to-one correspondence between the family of complete Bernstein functions and the set of Krein strings or, equivalently, a family of subordinators and a set of one-dimensional diffusions. The repository contains the simulations found in the author's PhD thesis which can be divided into to three related projects.

## Bessel Process Example - `Bessel_and_Trace_Process.py`
The first program is a simulation of the most important example of the Krein correspondence given by a Bessel process whose inverse local time process is given by a stable suborinator.

This program simulates a sample path of a Bessel process, calculates the corresponding local time process and then plots
