# Krein Correspondence Simulations
One of the key results that is used in the author's PhD thesis is the *Krein correspondence* which provides a one-to-one correspondence between the family of complete Bernstein functions and the set of Krein strings or, equivalently, a family of subordinators and a set of one-dimensional diffusions. The repository contains the simulations found in the appendix of author's PhD thesis.
