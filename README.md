One of the key results that is used in the author's PhD thesis is the Krein correspondence which provides a one-to-one correspondence between the family of complete Bernstein functions and the set of Krein strings. This result can be interpreted in both a probabilistic setting and an analytic setting. The repository contains the simulations found in the author's PhD thesis which can be divided into to three related projects.

The first is the simulation of the most important example of the Krein correspondence
