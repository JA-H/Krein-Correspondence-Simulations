# Krein Correspondence Simulations
One of the key results that is used in the author's PhD thesis is the Krein correspondence which provides a one-to-one correspondence between the family of complete Bernstein functions and the set of Krein strings or, equivalently, the inverse local time processes of one-dimensional diffusions and a family of subordinators. This result can be interpreted in both a probabilistic setting and an analytic setting. The repository contains the simulations found in the author's PhD thesis which can be divided into to three related projects.

## Bessel Process Example
The first program is a simulation of the most important example of the Krein correspondence given by a Bessel process whose inverse local time process is given by a stable suborinator. found in the `Bessel_and_Trace_Process.py` file.

 This program simulates a sample path of a Bessel process, calculates the corresponding local time process and then plots
